#Overview

The previous two labs showed us how easily you can connect an IoT to IBM Bluemix and leverage the Watson analytics and external APIs (Twitter and Twilio). This lab demonstrates a further integration of the IoT with smart devices. This lab will show you how you can connect an iOS app with an IoT with the usage of IBM Watson IoT Platform. Optionally we will start to communicate with a robot connected to Raspberry Pi. We will add Voice User Interface to invoke commands on Raspberry Pi. And optionally Voice UI will be all for hands-free usage of the popular STEM robot – iRobot Create2.

## Prerequisites 
You need the following software/hardware:

-	finished all previous STEPS 1-5
-	(optional) iRobot Create2

In order to run the example you would need to run the ```pod install``` from the step6/ios/WatsonIoTCreate2 directory. Please use ```WatsonIoTCreate2.xcworkspace``` to open the project. You need to build the project to be able to leverage the MQTT client (press *play* arrow with the right simulated or actual device).
See the the attached code for setting up the connectivity thru MQTT/WatsonIoTPlatform/Bluemix to Raspberry Pi running Node.Red flow:

```swift
    /*
     "iotCredentialsIdentifier": "???????????",
     "mqtt_host": 
	"<step 1. your_org_id>.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com",
     "mqtt_u_port": 1883,
     "mqtt_s_port": 8883,
 "http_host": "<step 1. your_org_id>.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com",
 "org": "<step 1. your_org_id>",
 "apiKey": "<step 3. your_boilerplates_iot_apikey>",
 "apiToken": "<step 2. your_boilerplates_iot_token>"
     */

    let ORG_ID = "<step 1. your_org_id>"
    let ioTHostBase = "messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com"
    let C_ID = "a: <step 1. your_org_id>:RaspberryPiCreate2App"
    let DEV_TYPE = "RPi3"
    let DEV_ID = "RaspberryPi3iRobotCreate2"
    let BEEP_MSG = "1" //play beep
    let DOCK_MSG = "2" //dock
    let IOT_API_KEY = "<step 3. your_boilerplates_iot_apikey>"
    let IOT_AUTH_TOKEN = "<step 2. your_boilerplates_iot_token>”
```    
With these parameters when a button is pressed you should create a connection to MQTT queues:

```swift
    let host = ORG_ID + "." + ioTHostBase
    let clientId = "a:" + ORG_ID + ":" + IOT_API_KEY
    let CMD_TOPIC = "iot-2/type/" + DEV_TYPE + "/id/" + DEV_ID + "/cmd/cmdapp/fmt/json"
iotfSession.connect(
                to: host,
                port: 1883,
                tls: false,
                keepalive: 30,
                clean: true,
                auth: true,
                user: IOT_API_KEY,
                pass: IOT_AUTH_TOKEN,
                will: false,
                willTopic: nil,
                willMsg: nil,
                willQos: MQTTQosLevel.atMostOnce,
                willRetainFlag: false,
                withClientId: clientId)
```
		
Finally, you are able to send a command over the created MQTT connection:

```swift
iotfSession.send(BEEP_MSG.data(using: String.Encoding.utf8, allowLossyConversion: false),
                             topic: CMD_TOPIC,
                             qos: MQTTQosLevel.exactlyOnce,
                             retain: false)

```

And the final Node.Red flow working with the Rapberry Pi that receives the command, and selects if it is a BEEP or DOCK:

If you have the robot (iRobot Create2) - you might want to connect it now:
